        <h2>Central Park - New York, NY, United States</h2>
        <p>Nothing beats taking a walk in Central Park with a cup of coffee in your hand to make yourself feel like a native New Yorker. Part of New York City’s charm is being able to enjoy the contrast between the concrete jungle of high-rises and skyscrapers, and the serene experience of nature, nestled within the Central Park. You will be missing out if you missed the opportunity to experience both.  New York summers are humid and uncomfortable (or so I’ve heard), so I highly recommend going in the spring or fall. This is also the best place for people watching and for feeding pigeons pieces of old stale bread. But I would definitely research if feeding wildlife is permissible. </p>

        <h2>Singapore Zoo (Mandai Wildlife Reserve) - Singapore</h2>
        <img src="images/singapore.jpg" alt="an image of a bush with a yellow sign that says'kangaroo crossing'." width="800" height="800">
        <p>An odd choice, and certainly not everyone’s first choice, but it made the list for a reason. Firstly, Singapore is one of the greenest (and most humid) cities I’ve ever visited. Despite being a small city, it houses one of the largest zoo’s in the world (?). The way the zoo is designed creates the illusion of walking through the jungle. Not because they were generous in surrounding the park with greenery, but they have areas where monkeys, and even kangaroos, are roaming free! So, by all means, enjoy your coffee there, but make sure a monkey doesn’t steal or knock it over. Side note, I would definitely opt for iced coffee in this case.</p>

        <h2>Hotel Playa Vista Azul - Varadero, Cuba</h2>
        <img src="images/cuba.jpg" alt="an image of a blue pool infinity pool overlooking the ocean." width="800" height="800">
        <p>A country known for coffee and beautiful beaches. There was no doubt it would make the list. Varadero may be a tourist area, but you can’t deny the scenic views are worth the upcharge on everything. My friends and I stayed at Playa Vista Azul, which contained a bright blue infinity pool overlooking the ocean. You could quite literally hear the awe from our tour group, every time we were dropped off in front of the lobby because you could see the pool even from inside the bus. If you’re tired of enjoying your coffee by the pool, the beach was just a 5-10 minute walk from your room. </p>
